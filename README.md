<h1><b>WebCrawler</b></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Write a simple web crawler in a programming language of your choice. The crawler should be limited to one domain - so when crawling sedna.com it would crawl all pages within the domain, but not follow external links, for example to the LinkedIn and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should output a site map, showing which static assets each page depends on, and the links between pages. 
We expect candidates to spend around 3 hours on this. Please share your solution in a GitHub repo and invite devops@sedna.com.

<h2>Running</h2>

Run Application.java and enter the URL in the console and hit enter.
